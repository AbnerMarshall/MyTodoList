# Organizational App

A simple web application for managing tasks and tracking weight, built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).

## Building for Production
